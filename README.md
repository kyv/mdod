# mDO Interactive Disk

The contents contents of this interactive disk were developed as a standard HTML5 web page. And the windowsy autostart scripts open those contents in a portable version of firefox. There is even a portable little web server running around in there.

Here you can find everything that makes the magic happen. There is even a script to build your own disk image. 

# HTML

The web page, minus media files, is under [HTML](./HTML) folder. You can find it online at [2006.ki-ai.org](2006.ki-ai.org).

# Dependencies

You need to place firefox portable in the FirefoxPortable folder and shellExec.exe in the root. We really don't think you will do that
because we really don't think anyone wants to make interactive disks. But in case you wondered, there you go. We left pinky in there (the little web server that could) becuase it was GPLed.
